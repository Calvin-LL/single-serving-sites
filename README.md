# Single-Serving Sites

A single-serving site is a website composed of a single page with a dedicated domain name and which serves only one purpose. This site tries to list all the cool ones.

## Contributing

To add your own single-serving site add a new `.json` file in the `src/_data/sites` folder and open a pull request.

Use the following template when adding a new site:  
```json
{
	"url": "https://example.com/",
	"title": "Example Title",
	"description": "Example description, keep it under 140 characters.",
	"launchDate": "2023-12-31",
	"author": "Your Name",
	"authorSite": "https://yourpersonalsite.com/"
}
```
